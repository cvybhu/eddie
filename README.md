Simple Ed25519 Elliptic Curve implementation

The goal of this project was to learn the Rust programming language by implementing elliptic curve Ed25519 from scratch.  
This is by no means a library ready for production use, it's not even constant time - DO NOT USE IT  
Project is done fully from scratch without any external dependencies to also learn bignum math.
